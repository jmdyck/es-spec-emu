# es-spec-emu
The current ECMAScript language specification,
formatted in [ecmarkup](https://github.com/bterlson/ecmarkup/)
(with [ecmarkdown](https://github.com/domenic/ecmarkdown)
and [grammarkdown](https://github.com/rbuckton/grammarkdown)).
Note that it doesn't necessarily conform to the latest (or perhaps any) version of these formats.
Things are in flux.

(See also [markdown-es6-spec](https://github.com/DanielRosenwasser/markdown-es6-spec)
for a similar effort using a different flavour of markdown.)
